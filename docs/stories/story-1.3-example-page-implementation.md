# Story 1.3: Example Page Implementation

## Status: Ready

## Story

As a Vibe Coder, I want to see a working example page on startup so that I can immediately verify the template is working and understand the core capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Working Example Page**
   - [ ] Default page displays a meaningful "Hello World"-style message
   - [ ] Page demonstrates the template's core capabilities
   - [ ] Clean, minimalist design that serves as a foundation

2. **Dark/Light Theme Toggle**
   - [ ] Toggle or button for switching between light/dark themes
   - [ ] Theme state persists across page refreshes
   - [ ] Smooth transitions between theme states
   - [ ] Theme provider properly implemented

3. **Tailwind Demonstration**
   - [ ] Demonstrates at least one custom Tailwind color from config
   - [ ] Shows responsive design patterns
   - [ ] Uses Tailwind utilities effectively
   - [ ] Proper dark mode classes applied

4. **Testing Coverage**
   - [ ] Basic unit test for theme toggle logic
   - [ ] Component rendering tests
   - [ ] Theme persistence tests

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Create Theme Provider System (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Install and configure theme provider (next-themes or custom)
  - [ ] Create theme context with light/dark mode support
  - [ ] Implement theme persistence in localStorage
  - [ ] Add theme toggle component

- [ ] Task 2: Build Example Page Components (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Create main landing page component
  - [ ] Add header with theme toggle
  - [ ] Create demo sections showcasing capabilities
  - [ ] Implement responsive grid layout
  - [ ] Add custom color demonstrations

- [ ] Task 3: Update App.tsx and Routing (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Replace default Vite content with example page
  - [ ] Wrap app with theme provider
  - [ ] Ensure proper CSS imports and setup
  - [ ] Test development server functionality

- [ ] Task 4: Implement Test Suite (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Set up Jest and React Testing Library if not present
  - [ ] Write theme toggle functionality tests
  - [ ] Add component rendering tests
  - [ ] Test theme persistence behavior
  - [ ] Ensure 80% test coverage for new components

## Dev Notes

### Theme Implementation Strategy
Based on the PRD requirements, the theme system should:
- Use a clean toggle button (not just a checkbox)
- Persist theme choice across sessions
- Provide smooth transitions between themes
- Follow accessibility best practices

### Example Page Content
The page should demonstrate:
- Custom Tailwind colors from the config
- Responsive design patterns
- Typography hierarchy
- Component composition
- Dark/light mode effectiveness

### Component Architecture
Suggested structure:
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── theme/
│   │   ├── ThemeProvider.tsx
│   │   └── ThemeToggle.tsx
│   ├── layout/
│   │   ├── Header.tsx
│   │   └── Footer.tsx
│   └── ui/
│       ├── Button.tsx
│       └── Card.tsx
├── pages/
│   └── ExamplePage.tsx
└── hooks/
    └── useTheme.ts
```

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for theme logic
- Component rendering tests
- Integration tests for theme persistence
- Coverage target: 80% for new components

### Dependencies to Consider
- `next-themes` for theme management (if not building custom)
- Additional testing utilities if needed
- Icons for theme toggle (lucide-react or similar)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Example page loads successfully on `npm run dev`
- [ ] Theme toggle works correctly in both modes
- [ ] Custom Tailwind colors are visible and working
- [ ] All tests pass with adequate coverage
- [ ] Page is responsive and accessible
- [ ] Theme preference persists across sessions
- [ ] Code follows established patterns and conventions
