# User Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding

## Story
As a developer, I want to initialize a new Vite React project with TypeScript and TailwindCSS pre-configured, so that I can start building features immediately without spending time on boilerplate setup.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Vite React Project Initialization**
   - [x] Create new Vite project with React and TypeScript template
   - [x] Project runs successfully with `npm run dev`
   - [x] Hot Module Replacement (HMR) works correctly

2. **TailwindCSS Integration**
   - [x] Install and configure TailwindCSS with PostCSS
   - [x] Configure `tailwind.config.js` with appropriate content paths
   - [x] Add Tailwind directives to main CSS file
   - [x] Verify Tailwind utilities work in a test component

3. **TypeScript Configuration**
   - [x] Configure `tsconfig.json` with strict mode enabled
   - [x] Set up path aliases for clean imports (e.g., `@/components`)
   - [x] Ensure TypeScript compilation has no errors

4. **Project Structure**
   - [x] Create organized folder structure:
     ```
     src/
     ├── components/
     ├── lib/
     ├── styles/
     ├── App.tsx
     └── main.tsx
     ```
   - [x] Remove default Vite boilerplate content
   - [x] Add `.gitignore` with appropriate exclusions

5. **Development Scripts**
   - [x] Ensure all npm scripts work correctly:
     - `npm run dev` - Start development server
     - `npm run build` - Build for production
     - `npm run preview` - Preview production build

## Technical Notes

- Use Vite 5.x and React 18.x
- Configure for Node.js 18+ compatibility
- Ensure fast refresh works with TypeScript

## Definition of Done

- [x] Project initializes and runs without errors
- [x] TailwindCSS utilities are functional
- [x] TypeScript compilation succeeds
- [x] Folder structure matches specification
- [x] All development scripts execute successfully
- [x] Code committed to repository with meaningful commit message
