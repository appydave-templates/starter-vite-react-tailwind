# User Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding

## Story
As a developer, I want to initialize a new Vite React project with TypeScript and TailwindCSS pre-configured, so that I can start building features immediately without spending time on boilerplate setup.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Vite React Project Initialization**
   - [ ] Create new Vite project with React and TypeScript template
   - [ ] Project runs successfully with `npm run dev`
   - [ ] Hot Module Replacement (HMR) works correctly

2. **TailwindCSS Integration**
   - [ ] Install and configure TailwindCSS with PostCSS
   - [ ] Configure `tailwind.config.js` with appropriate content paths
   - [ ] Add Tailwind directives to main CSS file
   - [ ] Verify Tailwind utilities work in a test component

3. **TypeScript Configuration**
   - [ ] Configure `tsconfig.json` with strict mode enabled
   - [ ] Set up path aliases for clean imports (e.g., `@/components`)
   - [ ] Ensure TypeScript compilation has no errors

4. **Project Structure**
   - [ ] Create organized folder structure:
     ```
     src/
     ├── components/
     ├── lib/
     ├── styles/
     ├── App.tsx
     └── main.tsx
     ```
   - [ ] Remove default Vite boilerplate content
   - [ ] Add `.gitignore` with appropriate exclusions

5. **Development Scripts**
   - [ ] Ensure all npm scripts work correctly:
     - `npm run dev` - Start development server
     - `npm run build` - Build for production
     - `npm run preview` - Preview production build

## Technical Notes

- Use Vite 5.x and React 18.x
- Configure for Node.js 18+ compatibility
- Ensure fast refresh works with TypeScript

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Project initializes and runs without errors
- [ ] TailwindCSS utilities are functional
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds
- [ ] Folder structure matches specification
- [ ] All development scripts execute successfully
- [ ] Code committed to repository with meaningful commit message

## Story Points: 3

## Priority: High (Must Have)

## Dependencies
