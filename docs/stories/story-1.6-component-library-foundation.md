# Story 1.6: Component Library Foundation

## Status: Completed

## Story

As a developer, I want a foundational set of reusable UI components so that I can build features quickly while maintaining design consistency and accessibility standards.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Core UI Components**
   - [x] Button component with multiple variants (primary, secondary, outline, ghost)
   - [x] Card component with header, body, and footer sections
   - [x] Input component with validation states
   - [x] Modal/Dialog component with overlay and focus management
   - [x] Loading spinner component

2. **Component Variants and States**
   - [x] Each component supports size variants (sm, md, lg)
   - [x] Proper hover, focus, and active states
   - [x] Disabled states where applicable
   - [x] Dark mode compatibility for all components

3. **Accessibility Standards**
   - [x] Proper ARIA attributes and roles
   - [x] Keyboard navigation support
   - [x] Screen reader compatibility
   - [x] Focus management and visual indicators

4. **TypeScript Integration**
   - [x] Proper TypeScript interfaces for all props
   - [x] Generic types where appropriate
   - [x] Strict typing with no 'any' types
   - [x] Export all component types

  - [x] Add TypeScript strict checking
  - [x] Configure ESLint for component quality

## Dev Notes

### Component Architecture
Following the existing pattern in `src/components/ui/`, expand the component library with:
```
src/components/ui/
├── Button.tsx (enhance existing)
├── Card.tsx (enhance existing)
├── Input.tsx
├── Label.tsx
├── Select.tsx
├── Textarea.tsx
├── Modal.tsx
├── Spinner.tsx
├── Progress.tsx
├── Toast.tsx
├── Alert.tsx
└── index.ts (barrel exports)
```

### Design System Integration
- Use existing Tailwind theme colors from `tailwind.config.js`
- Follow the established dark mode patterns
- Maintain consistency with existing Header/Footer styling
- Use CSS custom properties for theme-aware styling

### Accessibility Requirements
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Proper semantic HTML elements
- Focus management for interactive components
- Color contrast ratios meet accessibility standards
- Screen reader announcements for state changes

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each component using React Testing Library
- Accessibility tests using jest-axe
- Visual regression tests with Storybook
- Interaction tests for keyboard navigation
- Coverage target: 85% for new components

### Dependencies to Consider
- `@radix-ui/react-*` for unstyled accessible components (optional)
- `class-variance-authority` for component variants
- `@storybook/react` for component documentation
- `jest-axe` for accessibility testing

## Definition of Done

- [x] All core UI components implemented and tested
- [x] Components follow consistent API patterns
- [x] TypeScript interfaces are complete and exported
- [x] Accessibility standards met for all components
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage (50 tests passing)
- [x] All tests pass with adequate coverage
- [x] Components work in both light and dark themes
- [x] Code follows established conventions and patterns
